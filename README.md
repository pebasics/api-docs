# PEB Ecosystem API Documentation
## Overview

The PEB Ecosystem API provides a robust and versatile interface for developers, content creators, and users to integrate seamlessly with the PEB platform. As part of our commitment to openness and accessibility, this API enables smooth integration across various applications while fostering innovation and collaboration within the Ecosystem.

This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide to help you understand, use, and integrate with the PEB Ecosystem API effectively.
## Why Documentation Matters

Documentation is essential to achieving the vision behind the PEB Ecosystem: to create a free, open, and developer-friendly platform. By providing detailed information about API usage, this documentation empowers developers to build integrations that align with their unique requirements, ensuring flexibility and efficiency.
## API Endpoints

The API is organized into multiple endpoints, each categorized by its functionality and version. Endpoints are structured to support backward compatibility while allowing for continuous improvement and innovation:

### Versioning
Each endpoint is associated with a specific API version.
Newer versions of endpoints introduce improvements or changes, while older versions remain available until officially deprecated.

### Deprecation Policy
Older endpoint versions will be marked as outdated but continue to function until their designated end-of-support date.
After the end-of-support date, outdated endpoints will either:
Return a 404 Not Found HTTP status code.
Redirect to the newer version of the endpoint where applicable.

### Documentation Structure
Endpoints are documented in dedicated folders within the API documentation.
Each folder corresponds to an API version and category, ensuring clarity and ease of navigation.

## Errors and Error Handling

To ensure reliability and user-friendly integration, the API provides a comprehensive error-handling mechanism:

### Error Types
Client-Side Errors: These occur due to incorrect input, such as missing required fields or invalid data.
Server-Side Errors: These are system-level errors that may occur during API processing.

### Error Documentation
Each endpoint includes a detailed list of potential errors, with descriptions of their causes and solutions.
Errors are organized within the Errors folder for quick reference and troubleshooting.

### Error Responses
All errors are returned with clear HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 500 Internal Server Error) and descriptive error messages.

## Conclusion

The PEB Ecosystem API is designed to be intuitive, reliable, and future-proof, enabling seamless integration and fostering innovation. Explore the documentation, experiment with the endpoints, and create something amazing within the PEB Ecosystem!
